# MamaMind – Digital MCP Card for Maternal Health

## Problem Statement
In India, every pregnant woman receives a physical Mother and Child Protection (MCP) card to track pregnancy and child health data. However, these cards are often lost, damaged, or poorly maintained. They do not provide reminders, backups, or easy access to health history, leading to missed checkups and vaccinations.

## Solution
MamaMind is a web-based digital substitute for the MCP card. It securely stores maternal health records, allows role-based access for patients, ASHA workers, and doctors, and helps track pregnancy milestones and immunization schedules.

## Key Features
- Role-based login (Patient, ASHA Worker, Doctor)
- Digital MCP card dashboard
- Pregnancy and ANC visit tracking
- Immunization schedule tracking
- Notes and observations by health workers
- Reminder-ready architecture

## User Roles
- **Patient**: View personal health records and pregnancy progress
- **ASHA Worker**: Update ANC visits and vitals
- **Doctor**: Review patient history and add medical notes

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Firestore Database
- Firebase Hosting

## Data Privacy
All data used in this project is simulated. No real patient data is collected. The system is designed with privacy-by-design principles.

## Live Demo
(Will be added after deployment)

## Future Scope
- WhatsApp reminders
- Multi-language support
- Offline-first PWA
- Government health system integration
